Install phreeqc on a Windows computer (my trial 1/25/2016)
   Download phreeqc from http://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc/
     I selected Batch Versions of PHREEQC, Windows, 64-bit processor, phreeqc-3.3.3-10424-x64.msi
     It is in C:\Program Files\USGS\phreeqc-3.3.3-10424-x64 once installed
   
   To run it, I open Command Prompt
      change the directory  
      "C:\Program Files\USGS\phreeqc-3.3.3-10424-x64\bin\phreeqc.bat" ex1som4.phrq
      It shows a figure after it finishes

I believe installation on Mac Os is a bit easier. Just download phreeqc-3.3.3-10424.dmg, run it. I have the following in my .bash_profile under my home directory 

export PATH="/Users/t6g/Applications/phreeqc-3.1.3-8914/bin:$PATH"
export PHREEQC_DATABASE=/Users/t6g/Applications/phreeqc-3.1.3-8914/database/phreeqc.dat
